# Machine Learning Handbook

Machine learning is a growing technology that enables computers to learn automatically from past data.

Machine learning uses various algorithms for **building mathematical models and making predictions using historical data or information.**

This machine learning tutorial gives you an introduction to machine learning along with a wide range of machine learning techniques such as **Supervised, Unsupervised, and Reinforcement learning.**

## What is Machine Learning

Machine Learning is said as a subset of artificial intelligence that is mainly concerned with the development of algorithms that allow a computer to learn from the data and past experiences on its own. 

The term machine learning was first introduced by Arthur Samuel in 1959.

## How does Machine Learning Work

A Machine Learning system learns from **historical data, builds the prediction models, and whenever it receives new data, predicts the output for it.**
The accuracy of predicted output depends upon the amount of data, as the huge amount of data helps to build a better model which predicts the output more accurately.
